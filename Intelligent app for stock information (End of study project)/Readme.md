# I - Presentation

My project is to build a cross-platform dashboard (web site, mobile application, …) for the finance domain which will propose many functionalities using AI. The application is aimed to respond to the increasing growth and popularity of the cryptocurrency market. 

The recent event related to the GameStop short squeeze by the reddit community, and the exponential value increase of Bitcoin led to this project idea.
The application will propose many functionalities which the main one will be to predict a score about a certain company using web scraping, Machine Learning and/or Deep Learning. You will find the detailed list of functionalities below.

# II – Datasets

The main source of data will be the web. So, my application will use web scraping to scrape data about a certain company or a certain share. The other source will be open source data about companies.
